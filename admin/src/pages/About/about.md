#### Central Pemit Management System
The **Government of Botswana** as part of Maitlamo saw it fit to move all government services online. Through this initiative, timely customer delivery and paperless applications and efficient management of applications and information will be attained.  [**'DevSQL Pty Ltd'**](devsql.co.bw)  was contracted through a hackathon challenge to develop a solution that will integrate open-source technologies to create a management system that will meet the needs of the **[Botswana Trade Commission](botc.org.bw)** and the  **[Ministry of Local Government and Rural Development](https://www.gov.bw/ministries/ministry-local-government-and-rural-development)**. The central permit management system was fully developed in Botswana by Batswana youth for Government officers.

The developers 'DevSQL Pty Ltd' developed this system to be highly available and scalable to meet the growing demand of Batswana in applying for government services that issue permits. The system only uses open-source technologies, making it easier to manage and maintain. The central permit management platform was build to be robust and easy to use. The initial implementation  of the system was targeted at BOTC and local government.
